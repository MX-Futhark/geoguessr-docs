# Guide to Bhutanese Milestones

By [MX-Futhark](https://www.geoguessr.com/user/5e6bccf53730754da880600a)

Training map [here](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/6991b7678360eaa98032ef6e) (only milestones with a legible road number).

JSON file [here](./map.json) (all milestones).

If you find a mistake in this document (typo, broken link, factual inaccuracy, etc.) or in the map (broken location, unofficial coverage, missing milestone, etc.), feel free to file an issue. Contributions will be mentioned above.

## Introduction

Bhutan’s official Streetview coverage dates back from 2013. Not only does Google Maps not display road names in the country, but the road naming system has drastically changed since then. What [few](https://sites.google.com/site/roadnumberingsystems/home/countries/bhutan) [resources](https://super-duper.fr/quiz2024/roads.php?country=BTN&language=en&tile=gmaps&border=thin&difficulty=false&timer=false&gmaplng=en) attempt to classify old road names or keep a mapping from old to new road names, while helpful, are either incomplete or inaccurate. This means that if you find a road number on a milestone on Streetview, you may be SOL.

But fear not, for I have mapped **every. single. milestone.** in Bhutan.

![Me after mapping hundreds of milestones: tag empty, tag broken](./img/i_am_very_funny.jpg)

To be fair, I might have missed a stone or two. I have [a good excuse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sCEF1s24xpC5qnDE6).

In this document, you will find:
* [An index of road numbers](#index) found at the top of milestones, with links to the relevant road section.
* [A systematic list of roads](#roads) where useful milestones can be found, along with an explainer about where specific road numbers can be found on them, if at all.

This document does not attempt to be comprehensive, so I also recommend exploring the [JSON file](./map.json) in [map-making.app](https://map-making.app/) for more details.

## Reading Milestones

In case you don’t know how a milestone works - everyone has to start somewhere, - it is essentially a three-in-one version of a road sign, kilometer marker, and [cow scratcher](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d8TbmY1CTc4uot5Z9).

In the following example, you are 107km along the AH-48 with Bunagu 4km ahead:

![Milestone example: 107km along the AH-48 with Bunagu 4km ahead](./img/milestones/ah48.jpg)

There does not seem to be an obvious rule as to where kilometer zero is chosen for any given road.

The reverse side of the stone contains more information about the next village(s) in the other direction.

The text can be written in [Latin script only](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LEYyZ3E8TfKyfwcp9), [Tibetan script only](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tt7tdYgJh47WFWSp9), or [both](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2kSXc8vXfDNFpjeu6). In fact, milestones are perhaps the only application for which learning how to read Dzongkha proves useful, especially since Google Maps only displays place names in Latin script. See [Romanization of Dzongkha](#dzongkha-romanization) to learn more.

Crucially, not all milestones have a road number on them. In such cases, it is very likely for all nearby stones to be similarly devoid of road numbers and you are better off looking for something else.

While milestones are found at intervals of one kilometer, you can also find [intermediary stones](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G8ocoUatmHrDgbLk7) (hectometer markers), usually every 200 meters, but those are not found everywhere and they tend to be quite inconsistent. Alongside the usual kilometer count on the side, they normally have a single digit on them, e.g. 6 = 600m from the previous milestone. They can occasionally contain the [road number](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qR5wUciuATYVZV2L7), but consider this the exception rather than the rule. Hectometer markers seem to display some regional characteristics but I did not map them.

## <span id="index">Index of Road Numbers</span>

If you found a milestone in-game and don’t know the road number displayed at the top, use the following links to jump to the relevant section.
Note that identical road numbers with different formatting or writing systems are treated separately.

⚠ This list only applies to bona fide milestones. Hectometer markers may display a road number that differs in formatting to that of nearby miletones, for example [SL-02](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qR5wUciuATYVZV2L7)  (note the leading zero) in [SL-2 territory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qzDVxbssM64pY2U88) rather than SL_02 territory.

## <span id="roads">Roads</span>

### <span id="chhudzom-bondey">Chhudzom - Haa - Bondey</span>

#### <span id="sl1">SL-1</span>

The road connecting Chhudzom to Bondey via Haa, plus the road to Damthang, exclusively appears as "SL-1" on milestones.

⚠ There are two suspicious SL-1 milestones in Thimphu: [#1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oeBAC5ad6ao3jFtj9), [#2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X61PHC18N9DPHJ3C6).

⚠ There is [a misplaced milestone in Lingzhi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DBj9MvUm5jDhJ3c68) that reads [SL-2](#sl2_latin) in SL-1 territory.

![SL-1 milestone example](./img/milestones/sl1.jpg)

![SL-1 bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/sl1.png)

![SL-1 close-up distribution](./img/closeup/sl1.png)

### <span id="paro-trashigang">Paro - Trashigang</span>

This is by far the longest road in the country. As such, it has an impressive number of aliases. Fortunately, that means that finding a road number makes it easy to regionguess the road.

#### <span id="sl2_latin">SL-2</span>

The westernmost part of the road only features milestones with "SL-2" in Latin script. That includes:
* The road to Drugyel Dzong from Paro
* The Paro - Chhudzom section
* The Thimphu - Wangdue Phodrang section
* Some distance east of Wangdue Phodrang

⚠ There is [a misplaced milestone in Lingzhi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DBj9MvUm5jDhJ3c68) that reads SL-2 in [SL-1](#sl1) territory.

⚠ The [AH-48](#ah48) used to be part of the SL-2, which is why there is a discontinuity between Chhudzom and Thimphu.

![SL-2 milestone example](./img/milestones/sl2_latin.jpg)

![SL-2 bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/sl2_latin.png)

![SL-2 close-up distribution](./img/closeup/sl2_latin.png)

#### <span id="sl2_biscriptal">གཞུང་ལམ ༢ ↵ SL-2</span>

Around Wangdue Phodrang, scattered alongside plain [SL-2](#sl2_latin) milestones, there are a few stones that read "[གཞུང་ལམ ༢](#dictionary) ↵ SL-2".

⚠ Not to be confused with [གཞུང་ལམ་༠༢ ↵ SL_02](#sl02) (note the difference in leading zero).

![གཞུང་ལམ ༢ ↵ SL-2 milestone example](./img/milestones/sl2_biscriptal.jpg)

![གཞུང་ལམ ༢ ↵ SL-2 bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/sl2_biscriptal.png)

![གཞུང་ལམ ༢ ↵ SL-2 close-up distribution](./img/closeup/sl2_biscriptal.png)

#### <span id="uncoated">Uncoated milestones without any information</span>

There is a sizable section of road in Wangdue Phodrang dzongkhag where one can find uncoated, usually very smooth-looking milestones. It is also quite common for them to be [broken at the base](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QWkYCtCRihH5Feqp7). Similar stones are very rare to find elsewhere, and they are [not usually as smooth](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1Uf444vjq9NEqp4a8).

⚠ Milestones [painted entirely in white](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xc7YpPwVa95C2v5E9) are considered separate.

![Uncoated milestone example](./img/milestones/uncoated.jpg)

![Uncoated milestone bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/uncoated.png)

![Uncoated milestone close-up distribution](./img/closeup/uncoated.png)

#### <span id="nh2">གཞུང་ལམ-༢ ↵ NH-2</span>

There are two clusters of milestones where the road number appears as "[གཞུང་ལམ-༢](#dictionary) ↵ NH-2":
* One between Chuserby and Trongsa
* One in far western Mongar dzongkhag.

⚠ The only arguable exception to these two clusters is [a lone, barely legible stone](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vCBghstZ7CrKL9wJA) at the Trongsa/Bumthang dzongkhag border.

⚠ There are very few nonstandard-looking milestones without any Dzongkha in the road number. They can be found in the same general vicinity as the Mongar cluster, although more spread out: [#1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AUucmU4EzoXQtUVg8), [#2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n6a3isGZKd9uFpXC7), [#3](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CnrWAjsMapcoyHar8) (that should be all of them).

![གཞུང་ལམ-༢ ↵ NH-2 milestone example](./img/milestones/nh2.jpg)

![གཞུང་ལམ-༢ ↵ NH-2 bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/nh2.png)

![གཞུང་ལམ-༢ ↵ NH-2 close-up distribution](./img/closeup/nh2.png)

#### <span id="sl02">གཞུང་ལམ་༠༢ ↵ SL_02</span>

Between Jakar and Ura, the road number is displayed as "[གཞུང་ལམ་༠༢](#dictionary) ↵ SL_02".

⚠ Not to be confused with [གཞུང་ལམ ༢ ↵ SL-2](#sl2_biscriptal) (note the difference in leading zero).

⚠ [Hectometer markers with "SL-02" written on them](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qR5wUciuATYVZV2L7) do not count.

![གཞུང་ལམ་༠༢ ↵ SL_02 milestone example](./img/milestones/sl02.jpg)

![གཞུང་ལམ་༠༢ ↵ SL_02 close-up distribution](./img/closeup/sl02.png)

#### <span id="pnh2">གཞུང་ལམ ༢ ↵ PNH-2</span>

Near the Bumthang/Mongar/Lhuntse dzongkhag tripoint, there is a small clusters of "[གཞུང་ལམ ༢](#dictionary) ↵ PNH-2" milestones.

![གཞུང་ལམ ༢ ↵ PNH-2 milestone example](./img/milestones/pnh2.jpg)

![གཞུང་ལམ ༢ ↵ PNH-2 bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/pnh2.png)

![གཞུང་ལམ ༢ ↵ PNH-2 close-up distribution](./img/closeup/pnh2.png)

#### <span id="pnh_latin">PNH</span>

Most of Mongar dzongkhag uses "PNH" for the Paro - Trashigang road.

![PNH milestone example](./img/milestones/pnh_latin.jpg)

![PNH bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/pnh_latin.png)

![PNH close-up distribution](./img/closeup/pnh_latin.png)

#### <span id="pnh_biscriptal">གཞུང་ལམ ↵ PNH</span>

Scattered among the western part of the [PNH](#pnh_latin) cluster, one can find a few biscriptal stones: "[གཞུང་ལམ](#dictionary) ↵ PNH".

![གཞུང་ལམ ↵ PNH milestone example](./img/milestones/pnh_biscriptal.jpg)

![གཞུང་ལམ ↵ PNH bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/pnh_biscriptal.png)

![གཞུང་ལམ ↵ PNH close-up distribution](./img/closeup/pnh_biscriptal.png)

#### <span id="zhunglam2">གཞུང་ལམ-༢ ↵ ZHUNGLAM-2</span>

The road section from Yadi to Trashigang uses "[གཞུང་ལམ-༢](#dictionary) ↵ ZHUNGLAM-2".

![གཞུང་ལམ-༢ ↵ ZHUNGLAM-2 milestone example](./img/milestones/zhunglam2.jpg)

![གཞུང་ལམ-༢ ↵ ZHUNGLAM-2 bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/zhunglam2.png)

![གཞུང་ལམ-༢ ↵ ZHUNGLAM-2 close-up distribution](./img/closeup/zhunglam2.png)

#### <span id="coated_no_info_nh2">Coated milestones without any information</span>

The remaining sections of the Paro - Trashigang road are mostly populated by typical milestones (rounded top, white body, yellow top) without any information whatsoever.

![Coated milestone without info along the Paro - Trashigang road example](./img/milestones/coated_no_info.jpg)

![Coated milestone without info along the Paro - Trashigang road bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/coated_no_info.png)

![Coated milestone without info along the Paro - Trashigang road close-up distribution](./img/closeup/coated_no_info_nh2.png)

⚠ Identical milestones can be found, with scattered exceptions, along the [Gelephu - Trongsa road](#coated_no_info_nh4), as well as [east of Phuentsholing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JRpo5QHUD94rU82k6):

![Coated milestone without info east of Phuentsholing close-up distribution](./img/closeup/coated_no_info_east_of_phuentsholing.png)

### <span id="phuentsholing-thimpu">Phuentsholing - Thimphu</span>

#### <span id="ah48">AH-48</span>

Although it used to be part of the [SL-2](#sl2_latin), the Phuentsholing - Thimpu road is now entirely marked as AH-48 (Asian Highway #48).

![AH-48 milestone example](./img/milestones/ah48.jpg)

![AH-48 bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/ah48.png)

### <span id="wangdue-phodrang-tsirang">Wangdue Phodrang - Tsirang</span>

#### <span id="sl4">SL-4</span>

Milestone coverage between Wangdue Phodrang and Tsirang tends to be spotty due to long sections being under [heavy roadwork](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DFumN15NBBufGKe78), but the sections where milestones can be found all read "SL-4".

![SL-4 milestone example](./img/milestones/sl4.jpg)

![SL-4 bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/sl4.png)

![SL-4 close-up distribution](./img/closeup/sl4.png)

### <span id="sopsokha-punakha">Sopsokha - Punakha</span>

#### <span id="dr">DR</span>

There are a few district roads (DRs) in the country, but interestingly, only the one west of Punakha is numbered as just "DR".

![DR milestone example](./img/milestones/dr.jpg)

![DR bird’s-eye view distribution](./img/distribution/dr.png)

### <span id="chuzomsa-punakha">Chuzomsa - Punakha</span>

#### <span id="fr">FR</span>

Feeder Roads (FRs) tend not to have any milestones on them, but the road north of Chuzomsa leading to Punakha dzongkhag, in western Wangdue Phodrang dzongkhag, is one exception and is numbered as just "FR". Milestones are commonly flat-topped, but [not always](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FqGn2XL7wPyKWkW17).

⚠ The [Mongar - Lhuntse road](#dr47) has an offroad with [a single stone](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CsWfBiQxiupdesp78) that reads "[ཨེཕ་ཨར](#dictionary) FR".

![FR milestone example](./img/milestones/fr.jpg)

![FR close-up distribution](./img/closeup/fr.png)

### <span id="tsirang-dagana">Tsirang - Dagana</span>

The Tsirang - Dagana road is another district road without a number. Milestones will read "DISTRICT ROAD" in Latin script, Tibetan script, or both, in alternation.

#### <span id="district_road_latin">DISTRICT ROAD</span>

"DISTRICT ROAD" is latin script can be found in the last ¾<sup>ths</sup> of the Tsirang - Dagana road.

"[རྫོང་ཁག་འགྲུལ་འཁོར་ལམ](#dictionary)" (the equivalent of "DISTRICT ROAD" in Tibetan script) can be found in the last ¾<sup>ths</sup> of the Tsirang - Dagana road.

![རྫོང་ཁག་འགྲུལ་འཁོར་ལམ milestone example](./img/milestones/district_road_tibetan.jpg)

#### <span id="coated_info_district_road">Coated milestones with information</span>

The first fourth of the Tsirang - Dagana road is punctated by typical milestones (rounded top, white body, yellow top) with information but no road number on them.

⚠ [Similar hectometer markers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iUYuiWXv6ud1RT2w5) can be found elsewhere, but they do not count. They look visibly smaller than usual milestones.

⚠ Comparable milestones can be found, with scattered exceptions, along the [Trashigang - Samdrup Jongkhar road](#coated_info_trashigang_samdrup_jongkhar), as well as northwest of Walakha:

![Coated milestone with info along the road northwest of Walakha close-up distribution](./img/closeup/coated_info_northwest_of_walakha.png)

Note that milestones along the Trashigang - Samdrup Jongkhar road should be consistently quite tall, while they are of varying height in other places.

### <span id="gelephu-tsirang">Gelephu - Tsirang</span>

#### <span id="zhunglam5">གཞུང་ལམ-༥ ↵ ZHUNGLAM-5</span>

The Gelephu - Tsirang is consistently numbered as "[གཞུང་ལམ-༥](#dictionary) ↵ ZHUNGLAM-5".

![གཞུང་ལམ-༥ ↵ ZHUNGLAM-5 close-up distribution](./img/closeup/zhunglam5.png)

### <span id="gelephu-trongsa">Gelephu - Trongsa</span>

The Gelephu - Trongsa road is weird in that it only has one name, but is is not written everywhere, and the distribution of the two possible road number formats makes little sense. In addition, dirty milestones and poor visibility in the southern part of the road make it difficult to read the road number in the first place.

#### <span id="nh4_latin">NH-4</span>

"NH-4" in Latin script only is mostly found in two places:
* Some distance south of Trongsa
* Around Zhemgang

⚠ There is [a lone milestone south of Dandung that appears to read NH-3](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fvehNSd2pGCoWths8) instead of NH-4.

The Mongar - Lhuntse has two names. The transition occurs roughly at the dzongkhag border.

#### <span id="dr46">དྲི་ཨར ༤༦ ↵ DR46</span>

In Mongar dzongkhag, the Mongar - Lhuntse road is known as "[དྲི་ཨར ༤༦](#dictionary) ↵ DR46".

#### <span id="snh">SNH</span>

The majority of the Trashigang - Trashiyangtse road is numbered as "SNH", without a hyphen.

⚠ There is a stone in Duksum with [DR-4 on one side and SNH on the other](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z6keYhQN11PRdmqh6). No other mention of the DR-4 can be found anywhere else, perhaps with [one exception](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9L6enKiAcfDbftWn9) whose full road number was not legible enough to determine with certainty.

Note that milestones along the Trashigang - Samdrup Jongkhar road should be consistently quite tall, while they are of varying height in other places.

### <span id="dzongkha-romanization">Romanization of Dzongkha</span>

The Latin script transcription of Dzongkha on Google Maps is more or less a diacritic-free version of [Roman Dzongkha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Dzongkha) (⚠ at the time of writing, Wikipedia shows the outdated 1991 version of the system).

The only up-to-date learning resource for Roman Dzongkha is section 3.6 "Roman Dzongkha and traditional orthography" of [The Grammar of Dzongkha (Karma Tshering & George van Driem, Himalayan Linguistics 2019)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1h4211k0). Appendix 3 "Place Names" is also particularly helpful. The book is not an easy read though, both because of its academic tone and because romanizing a language whose writing system has long diverged from its phonology is a complex task.

You can go a long way with the much easier to learn [Wylie transliteration system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration), but you have to keep in mind that you may encounter place names whose Wylie transliteration differs significantly from how they appear on the map. For example, Samdrup Jongkhar: བསམ་གྲུབ་ལྗོངས་མཁར, Wylie "bsam grub ljongs mkhar".
